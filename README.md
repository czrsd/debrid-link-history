# Debrid Link History

This is a Tampermonkey userscript that keeps track of the debrid links you generate on debrid-link.com. It saves them right in your browser using IndexedDB. You can scroll through your old links, search and check out the details anytime.

Debrid-Link lets you download or stream files from 150+ hosts with just one account. Paste a link, and it gives you a fast, no-wait download or stream link. It also supports browser addons and tools like JDownloader2.

Popular supported hosts: Rapidgator, 1fichier, DDownload, Katfile, Mega, Fikper, Turbobit, Pixeldrain, Elitefile, Worldbytez, and more.

## What it does

- Shows a scrollable list of your generated links
- Loads 100 links at a time so it stays fast
- New links show up at the top
- You can search through your history
- Everything is saved locally in your browser

## Installation

1. Install Tampermonkey from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).
2. After installing Tampermonkey, click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser.
3. Select **Create a New Script**.
4. Copy the content of the script provided into the editor.
5. Save the script and ensure it's enabled.
6. Go to your browserâ€™s extensions page and enable Developer Mode.
7. Reload the page where you generate your debrid links.

## Usage

Once it's running, it'll automatically track every debrid link you generate.
- Scroll through your list to find old links
- Click a link to see the full details (host, size, expiration, etc.)
- Delete links from history if you want

## How It Works

- Uses your browser's IndexedDB to save everything
- Loads in chunks of 100 so it doesn't slow down
- Doesn't connect to any server; everything stays on your device

If you clear browser data, the history goes with it
